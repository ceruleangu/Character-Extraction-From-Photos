# Character Extraction From Photos

The code distinguishes small and unclear time characters (ex., 8:03 AM) from over a thousand colorful photos (video thumbnails) and writes each output to a csv file. Functions are developed to deal with results with incorrect format and infer the characters that cannot be distinguished successfully. The code also includes creating video thumbnails using the <tt>ffmpy</tt> library.
